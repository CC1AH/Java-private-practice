Some people say, the 21st century is an era based on the Internet. So it is, and I used to feel honored when I was introducing myself as a student of Software Engineering.

----------Preface
Internet, builds a totally new world besides reality.	 Nobody knows who we are, nothing will be inaccessible. It does provided us with us so much convenience and entertainment.
